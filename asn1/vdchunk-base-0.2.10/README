Install this software using the commands

"./configure"
"make"
"sudo make install" (or, if you are root: "make install")

This will install the library in the directory "/usr/local/lib/". If you want it to be installed in "/usr/lib/", you can give an option to the "configure" command:

"./configure --prefix=/usr"

This is necessary for some Linux distributions that do not look into "/usr/local/lib/" when searching for libraries (e.g. Ubuntu, kubuntu).Alternatively, you could soft-link the library to the proper place, e.g.:

"sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/libvdchunk-cryptopp.so.0 /usr/lib/libvdchunk-cryptopp.so.0"

Another option would be to change the environment variable "LD_LIBRARY_PATH" (this is usually not recommended anymore).
