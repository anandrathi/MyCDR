OMOSAP
One More Open-Source ASN1 Parser

(C) 2007-2009 Ingo Naumann

Installation:

a) That's how it is supposed to be:

- Install the package "vdchunk-base", see http://research.naumachiarius.com/software/vdchunk.html, at least version 0.2.2
- Unpack the contents of this package, go to the directory
- type "make"
- The executable is the file "omosap", type "./omosap filename" to start parser

b) Simple Work-Arounds:

- For installation on Apple MAC OSX, remove the word "-static" of the second line of "Makefile".
- If you have the package "vdchunk-cryptopp" installed on your computer (instead of "vdchunk-base"), you have to change the package name in the first line of "Makefile"
